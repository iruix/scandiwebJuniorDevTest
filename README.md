# scandiwebJuniorDevTest

This is a Junior Developer Test I made for Scandiweb

You can run the oop folder files from http://scandiwebphptest.000webhostapp.com/index.php

I created Procedural first, then I made it Object Oriented, because I am not very familiar with OOP, but I want to and am willing to learn about it.

The project uses Bootstrap for design and alignment, PHP to connect with the database and JQuery to change dynamically "Add Products" page.
